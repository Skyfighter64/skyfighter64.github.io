# GitHub Pages
This is the Repository for my Github Pages Website [https://skyfighter64.github.io/](https://skyfighter64.github.io/).

It contains mostly summaries of some of my personal projects.


## Building the website
Note: jekyll, ruby and builder need to be installed first
Build Locally:
```sh
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
The online version is built automatically as soon as changes are applied to the gh-pages branch.
